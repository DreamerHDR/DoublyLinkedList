Task: Data structure template – doubly linked list (non-cyclic), each element of the list contains a pointer to an object. To speed up the procedure for traversing the data structure, there is a dynamic array of pointers to every 10th element of the list (0,10,20, etc.).
Additional realization: For a given two-level data structure containing pointers to objects (or themselves objects) - template parameters, develop a complete set of operations (adding, including and extraction by logical number, sorting, including in order, loading and saving strings in a text file, balancing – aligning the dimensions of data structures lower level). It is assumed that the comparison operations of stored objects are overridden in a standard way (in the form of operations <,>, etc..). The program must use a template class with string objects and implement the above actions on text of any size, loaded from a file.
